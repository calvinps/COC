&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply put, we are Christian students at the
University of Michigan who love Jesus Christ and also love to enjoy Him together! <b>All Christians are welcome to join us</b> and even students who don't believe in the
Lord but still have interest in the Christian faith.  Quite honestly, we are not for the promotion of our club. We are for the testimony of the living Jesus on our campus!

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel it's vital to have other Christian companions throughout our college years to encourage and strengthen our faith.  It's soooo easy to be distracted and lose focus of the Lord during this time; we'd rather spend these valuable years to know and experience His presence more.  And at the same time, we would like to reach out to our friends and other non-Christian students on campus, inviting them to "run the race" with us!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We meet together
with Christian families who care for us with their homes, meals, and many smiles.  It's our joy to see each other pursuing the Lord and our hope that the Lord will bless our family of students with many more. So why not come and ENJOY THE LORD WITH US!
