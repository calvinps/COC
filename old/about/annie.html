<center><h2>One Body</h2></center>

"One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
<br>Ephesians 4:4-6
<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This God we have is one God, one Lord, one faith. Yes. But what does it mean?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This verse has always struck me as something special but I never knew what it meant. I've always known there's only one true God, but to me it was just a fact.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 1998, this all changed. I took a trip with eight other brothers and sisters to Russia. I'd never met any of them before and some were from the U.S, some from Canada. That summer, these verses became real. Yes – they were Russian. Yes – I'm Chinese (although I grew up in the U.S.). Yes – we spoke different languages, but we shared one enjoyment of the Spirit. We loved the same Lord and had faith in one God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two weeks time, the nine of us traveled from city to city within Moscow and southern Russia (Rostov). In that time we visited over a dozen families in their homes and meetings in seven cities. This amounted to meeting over 200 brothers and sisters there. With each family I felt warmly accepted and right at home. We sang hymns, shared our experiences – we had nothing in common besides Jesus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it is very easy to forget God's will for His church – we are surrounded at every side by meeting places and churches – it is so easy to lose sight of this one God. But this is God's word to us…One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
