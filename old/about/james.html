<center><h2>Real Faith</h2></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a fanatic. Ok, I am a fanatic. But I'm a nice guy, really. I just have this thing about Jesus Christ. To me, He's a real living Person who shares my life with me. This is what the rest of the world sees as fanatical. But deal with it. That's me. I think people have a problem dealing with spiritual things. It's just so weird to people. But Jesus Christ is more than an imaginary friend to me. It takes faith to believe this, but once you get past this what-I-can-see versus what-I-can't-see thing, it becomes possible.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean think about it. We believe in a lot of things we can't see, like gravity. Ok, bad choice. How about evolutionary theory? We take it for granted that it's a fact that mankind came from the primordial ooze and somehow coalesced into a magnificent shining civilization with web pages and 44.1 kHz CDs with super bit-mapping. If you can believe this, guess what? You have more faith than you're giving yourself credit for.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, I'm not trying to talk you into anything. That's too hard, because if you're human, you probably have an emotionally-based attachment to what you believe, just like you might think that I do. And once that belief bears itself out in your experience, forget it. It's in you, and dynamite couldn't remove it. Face it, you're human, and you need to believe in something. That's how we're constructed.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just assume, for the sake of argument, that it's not so crazy that I believe in this Guy who died 2,000 years ago. Then, suppose that, along with this belief came a series of curious changes in my life. Suppose that I started getting better grades in college, where before I had been failing. Then suppose my personality gradually changed and I became a person who started forgiving people who made me mad before. Suppose that I stopped being lonely, unhappy, and closed-in, and that I began to value myself and others more highly. Suppose I became a happier person who opened his heart to people and learned to cry.
Suppose a guy who couldn't cry at his own mother's funeral started crying whenever he thought of how much he loved his wife and his son.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's assume this same guy all of a sudden learned how to finish what he started, where before his life was a series of false starts. Here's a good one: this guy, me, routinely prays for other people, and their lives begin to change for the better. Suppose he prays for stuff, and gets whatever he prays and asks God for. Suppose he loses the best job he ever had in his life, goes unemployed for seven years, and never once goes hungry, never loses his house, his cars, his family, or anything else.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose any time he had a need, it just materializes. People give him money, food, clothing, furniture; some of these people he never met and never even sees.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose his every dream comes true. Would you believe him then? Would you believe me then?

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a good one: suppose I told you Jesus Christ did all of that for me, and He'll do that for you too if you asked Him. Is it worth investigating? I don't know. You tell me.
