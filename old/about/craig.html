<center><h2>God is Love</h2></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Craig and all I have to say is the Lord has loved me tremendously. This may seem like a weird statement, especially coming from a man, but... this is just how He has touched me.  :)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many instances in my life where I was some how in a jam, and just by praying "Lord help me", miraculously something happened to let me know that there is a God that hears my prayers and is looking out for me. It is comforting to know that the Lord God Almighty, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords loves me…  My testimony today is for me to say that He loves you. God is love.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Words cannot express how my life has changed since we met. There is peace and unexplainable joy, especially knowing that He is by my side.
Being a Christian is not a religious duty. To me, it's more like a relationship, like when boy meets girl, except man meets God.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I realized I had a human spirit (truthfully when we first met), I wanted to tell the whole world of this love and the joy I had. Ever since then we have been growing together, or at least I have been growing more into His image and likeness.
