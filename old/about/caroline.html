<center><h2>Home Away From Home</h2></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired of dorm food? Need a break from studying? Then come on over to our house for a refreshing home-cooked meal!

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since my husband and I moved to Ann Arbor two years ago, we've been opening our home (and fridge and pantry!) to students who would like to meet with other Christians for food, fellowship and mutual encouragement.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been such a blessing to our family and I've really enjoyed meeting so many students from all over the world! Watching them grow in their love and pursuit of our dear Lord Jesus is an indescribable joy to me.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Christian life is exciting, dynamic, challenging and fulfilling. Come grow with us and enjoy your "home away from home!"
