<center><h2>Trusting in the Lord</h2></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this year, I believe that for the first time in my life, I've really learned that taking the Lord as my supply and trusting in Him really gives me much more supply. I have never given so much of my time to the Body-life before. I literally was with the saints seven days a week in the sister's house. I had meetings and fellowship with the Body at least six days a week. And, though, in my natural concept, giving up all this time should have resulted in less time for studying and a subsequent decline in grades, it hasn't. I've actually experienced that giving myself to a Christian life in the Body results in the Lord supplying me superabundantly in all my needs. When I give myself to His heart's desire, all things work out for good. Praise the Lord for His moving, working and growing in us.
