<center><h2>Are You Having Fun Yet?</h2></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may sound quite generic, but I know for a fact that at least 90% of the world's population likes to have fun. Some people see fun as reading a book, writing in a journal, or speaking in front of a large group of people. Others see fun as playing football, baseball, or ping-pong. Some may have fun partying where there is an abundance of liquor and women. Even though having fun is different for everyone, it is very important to the individual.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you how important fun is to me: I can't live without it. Throughout my high school years I loved to have fun. Fun for me in high school was getting drunk and partying whenever I had the opportunity. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't messed up at all. In the second semester of my senior year, I pulled off a 5.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale, and averaged a 3.95 GPA over the course of all four years. I was one of the top 20 all-around gymnasts in the state of Illinois and the 11th best ring-man in the state. I was involved in Spectrum and played the guitar for multicultural shows. I also played the piano for 12 years and baseball for eight years. I could also spin a basketball on one finger for five minutes. I could boastfully say that if someone could beat me in a sport or talent, I could beat them in 50 other sports or talents. When it came to my spiritual life, I was the top dog. I went to Sunday Lord's tables, Friday night meetings, and young people's special days. In my 18 years on this planet I have only missed around 20 Lord's table meetings and only a few young people's special days and meetings. I loved to touch my spirit, play the guitar in the meetings, and prophesy so that the Lord could make an impact on people's lives. Socially, I hung around a solid group of friends who would go to parties with me and who I could talk to about personal matters. Everything was not only balanced, but at the same time fun. If I could live the rest of my life like this, I would.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When college came around, everything in high school meant nothing. It was a clean slate for me and I continued my streak of success. I partied some more, making new friends and doing new and exciting things. I attended some of the Lord's day and Friday night young peoples meetings. School was going alright and I knew that if I didn't do so well, I still had seven semesters and four summers ahead of me to catch up. As always my life was in perfect harmony. It was the very day that I thought this thought that the Lord touched me. I didn't listen to Him and continued my streak of success by joining a fraternity. While I was in the fraternity, I knew that I did not belong there. With the help of a brother to help me see this, I eventually depledged.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this experience I realized that there is a big gap between the world and the church. You can't have one foot in the world and one foot in your spirit. It's either one or the other - there is a vivid distinction between the flesh and the spirit. Up to this point I had lived my entire life in mixture, facade, and blending between flesh and the spirit. My life suited me and my needs and I enjoyed living this life. Everything was for me, or in other words, for my flesh. After I quit the fraternity, I realized that everything in my life is for Christ and the church. When you are in your spirit, you have the real life within you. There is no more mixture and confusion of living in two worlds. There is only a world in Christ. Nothing else matters, nothing ever did matter, or nothing ever will matter in the future. What a distinction. I no longer had to think about even sticking my foot into the world again. I had only one choice - to touch my spirit. Let me tell you saints that this is the real enjoyment, the real fun.
