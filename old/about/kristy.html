<center><h2>Back to God</h2></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Kristy, a third year Mechanical Engineering student here at the University of Michigan. I do not have a humongous testimony on how two years ago I was "strung on drugs" or "heavy into sex" or anything like that. See, I have been a born again Christian since I was eight years old. So many times it feels as if I was born into Christianity.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you might ask "does that mean as an adult I have never sinned?" No, not at all. In fact, if I had a nickel for every time, at some points of my life it could have been a full-time job (funding all expenditures). But what I remember, what I hold close and what is with me now is that I've always found my way back to God. What does that mean "back to God?" Not that I am perfect or that I have achieved perfection but that I press for the mark of the high calling of God!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See I know it may seem intimidating, "How can I make a promise to God to change everything that I know my life to be this far?" But see without God that change is impossible, that short hop becomes a life-fearing leap of a dare devil. Without God EVERYTHING is that much harder.
At home in my neighborhood I watched; in school, now, I watch; from strangers to close friends, I watch. They (who are ignorant to the bliss of God) have life harder than those who know Him. Because He is so big, He makes everything else so small. As I sinned, when I sin, everything becomes harder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember a song most, "God is all around us, even when we fear we're all alone." Whether or not you want to believe in God, He already believes in you. Even though He promises us a rich after-life, He is not about death or then, but about the here and the now. Not that nothing bad ever happens - now let's be real! Things out of our control will ALWAYS HAPPEN. But His love, His point of view, His guidance grants us an entirely different perspective on it all.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is all around me, even when I feel I'm all alone. This is how I know Him.

<br>

<br>
By faith, by love, by grace,
<br>
Kristy
