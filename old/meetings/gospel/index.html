              &nbsp;In an effort to reach our fellow students and gospel friends, we have a monthly dinner and gospel meeting on campus. The turn out has been terrific! The Spirit has strongly anointed all of our meetings, as we have watched before our eyes people receive Jesus Christ into their lives. And since the guests who come are our friends, we take the lead in the meetings to speak out our testimonies of how Christ has changed our lives.
