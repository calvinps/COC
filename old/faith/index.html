&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, our faith is based solely on the Bible, the divine and infallible revelation of God (2 Pet. 1:20-21; 2 Tim. 3:16).

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we believe that our God is eternally and inseparably one and yet distinctly three: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (1 Tim. 2:5; Matt. 28:19).

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the person and work of Jesus Christ, we believe that He is both the complete God and the perfect man.  Without giving up His divinity, He incarnated, lived a human life on earth, and died a vicarious death on the cross, thereby accomplishing our redemption
(John 1:1, 14; 1 Pet. 2:24; Eph. 1:7a). After three days, He resurrected bodily and ascended to the heavens as the Lord of all (Acts 1:9; 1 Cor. 15:4). Hallelujah!! Finally, we look to the Lord's return, when He will come back with the kingdom of God and reign over all the earth for eternity (1 Thes. 2:19; Rev. 11:15).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on Christ's redemption, God can forgive sinners of their sins and regenerate them with His Spirit, making them His children (Eph. 1:7; John 1:12-13, 3:5-6). All these genuine believers of Christ are now enjoying daily the full growth of His divine life throughout their tripartite being (i.e. spirit, soul, and body) as members of the church, His Body (1 Thes. 5:23; Rom. 8:6, 10-11; Col. 1:28; Eph. 1:22-23).
