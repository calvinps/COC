<h2>Home Meetings</h2>
<br />
<!--<h2> -- Progressive Dinner</h2>
<p><strong>Friday ,  September 7, 2012 @ 6PM</strong><br />
  This is a special welcome dinner for new students that will be  in the homes of some local Christian families.   We will all gather at the same home (2621 Meade Ct, Ann Arbor MI 48105) at 6:00pm  and then break into smaller groups to visit several homes throughout the  evening, stopping at each home for one dish (i.e. salads at one home, soup at  another, main entrée at another). Then we will all end at the same house for  desserts.  This is a great opportunity  for the students to get to know each other and start some friendships that will  last through college and beyond. </p>
<p>To RSVP please email <a href="mailto:coc.info@umich.edu">coc.info@umich.edu<a></p>
<p>If you would like a ride, please call EJ at 714-510-0490 before 5:00pm on Friday.</p>-->
<p>Home meetings are held every Friday and Saturday night all year long. There are several local families that live near the campus who open up their homes, hearts, and refigerators to the students. For many students, their home meeting becomes like a home away from home where they can look forward to a home cooked meal and support and shepherding from older Christians.  Most home meetings begin eating at 7:00 and then have an hour or so of fellowship; which could include singing, reading, or praying for each other.  These families have a real love for the Lord and for students. It's also a great time for the students to get to know each other in a more meaningful way.  We hope you can join us this weekend for dinner!</p>
