					<p class="quotation">&quot;And let us consider one another so as to incite one another to love and good works, not abandoning our own assembling together…but exhorting one another… &quot; (Heb. 10:24-25a)</p>

<p> Jesus Christ is so rich!  To appreciate Him only individually is like trying to contain Niagara Falls in a Dixie cup.  We need many Dixie cups!   </p>

<p>Therefore, we come together during the week in small groups and large group meetings to share our enjoyment of Him with one another by singing, praying, reading, and fellowshipping “until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ”  (Eph 4:13) ”…that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God”  (Eph 3:19). </p>

			<h2>Small Group Bible Studies</h2>

			<p>We love God’s Word and enjoying it with one another.  If you are looking for someone to study the Bible with, our members will be happy to meet with you.  The small group studies are tailored to meet the needs of individual students—we will try to meet in the time and place most convenient and suitable for you.  Please contact us for more information. </p>

<p> &quot;For where there are two or three gathered into My Name, there am I in their midst&quot; (Matt 18:20).</p>
			

			<h2>Friday Night Meetings</h2>

			<p>Time: 6:45 PM on Fridays</p>
			<p>Place: at a local Christian family’s home (for directions and/or transportation feel free to contact us)</p>

			<p>This is the main Christians on Campus meeting, when most of our members gather together.  We like to take this time to catch up on each other’s week over dinner, and then enjoy our living God through singing, praying, and reading the Word and related materials.  For many of us, this is the highlight of a long week of school and what we reminesce about when looking back on our years at university.</p>			

<p>&quot;And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart&quot;  (Acts 2:46). </p>
		
		<h2>Lord’s Table Meeting</h2>
			<p> Time: 11:00 AM – 1:00 PM on Sundays </p>
			<p> Place: Turner Senior Resource Center (2401 Plymouth Rd # C)</p>
			<p>Some of our members meet together with local believers on Sunday morning to remember and praise our Lord and what He has accomplished for us.  During the first half, we have communion, in which we all “[speak] to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with [our] heart[s] to the Lord” (Eph 5:19).  In the second half, we share our enjoyment pertaining to a book in the Bible—being inspired by God’s Word and mutually sharing our experiences of Christ causes us to be built up in His Body. </p>
