<p> Jesus Christ is so rich!  To appreciate Him only individually is like trying to contain Niagara Falls in a Dixie cup.  We need many Dixie cups!   </p>

<p>Therefore, we come together during the week in small groups and large group meetings to share our enjoyment of Him with one another by singing, praying, reading, and fellowshipping “until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ”  (Eph 4:13) ”…that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God”  (Eph 3:19). </p>

			<h2>Bible Studies</h2>

		  <p>We love God’s Word and enjoying it with one another.  If you are looking for someone to study the Bible with, our members will be happy to meet with you.  The small group studies are tailored to meet the needs of individual students—we will try to meet in the time and place most convenient and suitable for you.  We try to put different students together according to heir time availability. Students can join Bibles study times that are already established or we would work with students' schedules to have other Bible studies at different times. </p>
		  <p>At the end of each semester, we often would also have a review session with some Christian students at Wayne State University. This is a time of presentating our enjoyment of the Word of God throughout the semester with students from Wayne State who also loves God and His Word.</p>
		  <p>Please contact us for more information. </p>

<p> &quot;For where there are two or three gathered into My Name, there am I in their midst&quot; (Matt 18:20).</p>
<h2> Home Gatherings</h2>

			<p>Time: 6:45 PM on Fridays and Saturdays</p>
			<p>Place: at local Christian families’ homes (<a href="contact_us.htm">contact us</a> for directions and transportation)</p>

			<p>Home gatherings are held every Friday and Saturday night all year long. There are several local families that live near the campus who open up their homes, hearts, and refigerators to the students. For many students, their home meeting becomes like a home away from home where they can look forward to a home cooked meal and support and shepherding from older Christians. Most home meetings begin eating at 7:00 and then have an hour or so of fellowship; which could include singing, reading, or praying for each other. These families have a real love for the Lord and for students. It's also a great time for the students to get to know each other in a more meaningful way. We hope you can join us this weekend for dinner!</p>			

<p>&quot;And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart&quot;  (Acts 2:46). </p>
		
		<h2>Lord’s Table Meeting</h2>
			<p> Time: 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM on Sundays </p>
			<p> Place: Turner Senior Resource Center (2401 Plymouth Rd # C)</p>
			<p>Some of our members meet together with local believers on Sunday morning to remember and praise our Lord and what He has accomplished for us.  During the first half, we have communion, in which we all “[speak] to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with [our] heart[s] to the Lord” (Eph 5:19).  In the second half, we share our enjoyment pertaining to a book in the Bible—being inspired by God’s Word and mutually sharing our experiences of Christ causes us to be built up in His Body. </p>
