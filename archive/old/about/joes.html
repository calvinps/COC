<center><h2>A Grain of Wheat</h2></center>

"Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."
<br>John 12:24
<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't believe it's been three years now since I've been at U of M! Looking back, I can say that I have been through a lot since then. Courses were stressful my freshman year and, seemingly, there wasn't too many students around me pursuing the Lord – at least not the way I imagined it would be in college. I felt alone. It was at this moment of desperation, though, that the Lord became that much more sweeter and realer to me than ever before. His presence was always reassuring and gave me rest from all of my worries. O how I love Him!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night especially sticks out in my mind, where I prayed in tears to the Lord for someone to love and pursue Him with. In a direct answer to that prayer, within a couple of weeks one of my classmates starting coming to the meetings and his heart was set on fire for God! That whole year too, my eyes were opened to see that the ones who were already around me were actually hand–picked by the Lord Himself to be with me, learn from and grow with during my years at U of M.  These ones included not only university students but also families from the church who really took care of me in my time of need. And finally, when I look around this year at the increasing number of students the Lord has gained among us, I can testify that the Lord is still answering that prayer! Praise Him!
