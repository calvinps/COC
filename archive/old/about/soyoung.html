<center><h2>The Lord Provides</h2></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came to my first meeting, I had been seeking the Lord for a while. I had know Him for as long as I can remember, but over the years I had drifted away from Him. For a while, I believed that I did not need Him. But through hardship and by maturing as I experienced life, I realized that God was my only reliable source of strength. I wanted to draw near Him again. But by then I had no idea how. For a few years, I lived with this frustration, which grew within me. I asked the Lord repeatedly how I can be closer to Him again. Through a strange turn of events (which were rather unexpected and unfortunate at the time), I came to live with a sister in Christ. By the time she explained her church to me, I was already interested and asked the Lord if this strange turn of events was His design in answer to my prayers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew I wanted to attend, but still I was hesitant. School work and simple doubt held me back. But one week I decided to try a meeting. I would never find out what it was like otherwise. At the meeting, what I saw was people who were full of Christ. They weren't perfect, flawless beings but normal people with enthusiasm for Christ, who strove to have Christ in their lives. I felt no pressure to be any certain way except to be myself. People at all levels of faith were assembled and accepted as they were.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, I have been going to the meetings fairly regularly (as time allows), and have grown in my knowledge of Christ. I know that throughout my life I will go through many experiences - both good and bad - but I know that the Lord will be with me through all of it. He has drawn me near Him, and I have been blessed with His presence and His company. Thank you, Lord.
