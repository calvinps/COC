<center><h2>Once I Thirsted</h2></center>

Once I thirsted for a fountain
<br>Something deep that would satisfy
<br>But the fountain that I drank from
<br>Left me searching and still so dry.
<br>Then one day I found Him,
<br>He satisfied my thirst,
<br>Became in me a deeper source
<br>Whence living waters burst.
<br>Now I drink Him!
<br><font size="1">Hymn 1327</font>
<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my experience. I was a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ but still I was searching for something. I wandered from church to church with my list of specific requirements, looking for a place to call my home. Then I realized that what I was really searching for was something that couldn't be found in a group of people. What I was searching for was in Christ. He was my home. My wandering ceased. Only He could satisfy. Only He could quench my thirst. What I had been looking for in people, I found instead in Christ. Now I am in the local church, enjoying Christ together with the saints. The difference is that I don't look for perfection from them. I don't look for them to care for me. Instead, we together look to Christ to satisfy all our needs. And He does! Hallelujah!
To anyone who's reading this, if you're a believer or not a believer, I encourage you with this stanza from the same hymn:

<br>
<br>Empty wanderer drop the striving –
<br>Isn't worth all the troublin';
<br>Open up your heart believing,
<br>Call "Lord Jesus" and He'll come in!
<br>Then today you'll find Him,
<br>And calling on His name,
<br>You're joined to Him, you're one with Him,
<br>You'll never be the same.
<br>You won't want to!
