<center><h2>Need a Mom?</h2></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! I'm Lydia. I'm one of the "moms" who cooks for the Friday night college meeting and offers encouraging words to lift you up when you're feeling blue. I always try to come to the college meetings prepared to share my words of wisdom – but instead I receive their words of joy and peace. I leave feeling enriched and enthralled by what they share with me. I'm so touched by their experiences of Christ and the love and care they show towards one another.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live in Dexter with my husband and children where we have a wonderful family life – but the love of my life is the Michigan campus, where all the precious students are found. You all have won my heart - I'm dedicated to being there for you. If you need a friend to fellowship and pray – call me – I'll be there. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
Love,
<br>
Lydia
