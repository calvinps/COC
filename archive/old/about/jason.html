<center><h2>A Year of Growth</h2></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being my Junior year @ the Univ. of Michigan, I had attended many different youth Christian groups. From them all I have taken away a new sense of what my faith means to me, but none like when I have discovered being a part of Christians on Campus. Brought to a meeting by a friend, I was encouraged by the group to look deep into why I was a Christian and to realize all that is possible through my faith in Jesus Christ. I learned how to read the Word more as a guide and not so much as a story teller; to interpret the meanings and lessons into my everyday situations. I learned how to pray, not that I prayed incorrectly, but how to pray from my heart was what I was lacking. Giving thanks for the small, everyday things that Jesus does for me is something else that I learned. All in all Christians on Campus has helped me to grow in my relationship with Jesus, but without pushing me into being this perfect being that I could not live up to. Thanks COC for a wonderful year of learning and growing.
