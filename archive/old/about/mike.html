<center><h2>Crazy for Jesus</h2></center>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! My name is Mike and I am a lover of the Lord Jesus! I wasn't always so crazy for Jesus, and like many of you, I'm sure I have quite a story to tell about how it all has come about (ask me for all the juicy details); but the short of the long of it is that Jesus Christ one day touched me and filled my empty, broken heart. I grew up hearing about Him my whole life, but until I actually touched Him… the Person… that everything I had heard about made sense. Now I can say today that God is my God! He is not just my parents' God and I do not have a second-hand Savior! I love Jesus Christ and have given my life to serve Him and follow Him wherever He would go! Today, I can say that the Lord Jesus is alive in me and has led me in the coming year to be a part of His expression in the city of Ann Arbor…what about you?
