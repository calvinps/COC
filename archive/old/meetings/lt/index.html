&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our members
meet together with local&nbsp; believers on Sunday morning to offer praise and worship to our God. During the first half, we have communion and every member joyfully participates in the singing and praying! We then go over a commentary pertaining to a book in the Bible at the second half; being inspired by God's Word and mutually sharing our experiences of Christ causes us to be built up in His Body.<br>
